<ul>
<h3>Problem 1</h3>
<h2>Bullying</h2>
<p>THESE ARE SOLOUTIONS IF YOU ARE BULLIED 
	<li>Make direct eye contact with the bully and use a calm but firm tone of voice to tell them to stop.</li>
	<li>If joking comes easy, try humor to shift the energy of the moment.</li>
	<li>Don't try to fight the bully. Instead, walk away if possible and find an adult to get help.</li>
	<li>Tell parents or a trustworthy adult about the situation so they can help create a plan to stop it.</li>
	<li>Bullies tend to pick on kids when they're alone, so try to stay near other children and adults.</li>
	<li>Sit near the front of the school bus, or ride the bus with a friend from the neighborhood.</li>
	</P>

<h3>Problem 2</h3>
<h2>Water pollution</h2>
<p>Water pollution is caused by many factors including (but certainly not limited to): uncontrolled construction sites, 
leaking sewer lines, stormwater runoff, accidental spills and leaks, improper discharge of wastes, mining activities, foundries,
 animal waste, and others. Options for water pollution solutions are equally diverse.
Freshwater is one of the most vital resources for all life on Earth. Much of the water we count on daily for cooking,
 bathing, and other routine activities is supplied from rivers, lakes, and other surface water sources. However,
 without widespread care and appropriate protection and treatment systems, our water sources are becoming more and more polluted.
 As a result of needs that have exceeded funding, there is an ever increasing gap occurring between the amount of public funding available 
 and the measures truly needed for implementing the quantity of water pollution solutions.</p>

<h3>Problem 3</h3> 
<h2> Garbage in the streets </h2>
<p>THIS PROBLEM IS VERY DANGEROUS SO YOU SHOULD KNOW HOW TO SOLVE THAT !
<li>The first that comes to mind is recycling…. the more we can recycle, the less garbage there is.</li>
<li>Home gardeners can also compost a certain amount of garbage mixed with soil and leaves. That reduces garbage.</li>
<li>When I was a child, we had a burn barrel, and burned some of our garbage.</li>
<li>Other solution that have at least been tried (and I don’t see as particularly desireable solution) is dumping at sea.</li>

	<h3>problem 4</h3>
	<h2>Being lonely</h2>
	<li>1. Connect through your sports, hobbies, passions or interests.
Meet like-minded people who share something that you also love. They will make time for you; other people already have full calendars.</li>
	<li>2. Talk to talk to elder people.
They have plenty of wisdom, time, and advice that they can share. By listening, you are also validating them as well as yourself.</li>
	<li>. Find out why you feel lonely.
Perhaps there is some bitterness, resentment, or guilt that you are carrying around. It is time to forgive yourself and others so that you have the best chance possible to connect with yourself and others.</li>

<p>
Reporting creulty
So what do you do if you notice an animal that appears to be suffering from one or more of these issues? Call your local animal welfare agency immediately.
In most areas, someone from the local animal control agency, humane organization, or animal shelter will be responsible for investigating and enforcing the local anti-cruelty laws, but if you don’t know who’s in charge in your city or town, you can always call the local police non-emergency number to find out who to report the cruelty to. Also, in many locales, 311 connects directly to city services, who will know where to direct you.
Fighting cruelty
Of course, the best way to fight cruelty is to teach as many people as possible how their pets should be treated — and what they should never ever do. Parents and educators should teach children how to safely and humanely interact with animals at an early age, as well as how they can tell if an animal is being harmed and what to do about it.
You can help spread the word by utilizing your own community to do so. For instance, you can share messages about proper treatment of animals on your social networks or offer to teach a class at your local elementary school or even pre-school.
Beyond this, people need to stand up for what they believe in when they witness animal cruelty and take a stand by reporting the behavior. The more often that abusive individuals are punished, the less likely others are to do the same thing.</p>

<h1> depression</h1>
<p>
Being depressed can make you feel helpless. You're not. Along with therapy and sometimes medication, there's a lot you can do on your own to fight back. Changing your behavior -- your physical activity, lifestyle, and even your way of thinking -- are all natural depression treatments.

These tips can help you feel better -- starting right now.

1. Get in a routine. If you’re depressed, you need a routine, says Ian Cook, MD. He's a psychiatrist and director of the Depression Research and Clinic Program at UCLA.

Depression can strip away the structure from your life. One day melts into the next. Setting a gentle daily schedule can help you get back on track.

2.Set goals. When you're depressed, you may feel like you can't accomplish anything. That makes you feel worse about yourself. To push back, set daily goals for yourself.

"Start very small," Cook says. "Make your goal something that you can succeed at, like doing the dishes every other day."As you start to feel better, you can add more challenging daily goals.

3. Exercise. It temporarily boosts feel-good chemicals called endorphins. It may also have long-term benefits for people with depression. Regular exercise seems to encourage the brain to rewire itself in positive ways, Cook says.

How much exercise do you need? You don’t need to run marathons to get a benefit. Just walking a few times a week can help.

4. Eat healthy. There is no magic diet that fixes depression. It's a good idea to watch what you eat, though. If depression tends to make you overeat, getting in control of your eating will help you feel better.</p>
