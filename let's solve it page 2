<h3>problem 4</h3>

	<h2>Being lonely</h2>

	<li>1. Connect through your sports, hobbies, passions or interests.

Meet like-minded people who share something that you also love. They will make time for you; other people already have full calendars.</li>

	<li>2. Talk to talk to elder people.

They have plenty of wisdom, time, and advice that they can share. By listening, you are also validating them as well as yourself.</li>

	<li>. Find out why you feel lonely.

Perhaps there is some bitterness, resentment, or guilt that you are carrying around. It is time to forgive yourself and others so that you have the best chance possible to connect with yourself and others.</li>

Reporting creulty

So what do you do if you notice an animal that appears to be suffering from one or more of these issues? Call your local animal welfare agency immediately.

In most areas, someone from the local animal control agency, humane organization, or animal shelter will be responsible for investigating and enforcing the local anti-cruelty laws, but if you don’t know who’s in charge in your city or town, you can always call the local police non-emergency number to find out who to report the cruelty to. Also, in many locales, 311 connects directly to city services, who will know where to direct you.

Fighting cruelty

Of course, the best way to fight cruelty is to teach as many people as possible how their pets should be treated — and what they should never ever do. Parents and educators should teach children how to safely and humanely interact with animals at an early age, as well as how they can tell if an animal is being harmed and what to do about it.

You can help spread the word by utilizing your own community to do so. For instance, you can share messages about proper treatment of animals on your social networks or offer to teach a class at your local elementary school or even pre-school.

Beyond this, people need to stand up for what they believe in when they witness animal cruelty and take a stand by reporting the behavior. The more often that abusive individuals are punished, the less likely others are to do the same thing.</p>
